# Chirp! Project Report
## Design and architecture
### Domain model
Provide an illustration of your domain model. Make sure that it is correct and complete. In case you are using ASP.NET Identity, make sure to illustrate that accordingly.

'The domain model consists of Author and Cheep.
Author represents a user in the system and is integrated with ASP.NET Identity.
An author can create multiple cheeps, and each cheep belongs to exactly one author.
Authors can follow other authors, forming a many-to-many relationship.
A cheep contains textual content and a timestamp.
All entities are persisted using Entity Framework Core via ChatDBContext.'

### Architecture — In the small
Illustrate the organization of your code base. That is, illustrate which layers exist in your (onion) architecture. Make sure to illustrate which part of your code is residing in which layer.

'The application follows an onion architecture.
The presentation layer is implemented in Chirp.Web and contains Razor Pages, page models, and authentication endpoints.
The application layer is represented by service and DTO abstractions defined in Chirp.Core.
The domain logic is centered around the Author and Cheep entities.
The infrastructure layer is implemented in Chirp.Infrastructure and contains repository implementations, database context, migrations, and ASP.NET Identity integration.
Dependencies point inward toward the core and domain layers.'

### Architecture of deployed application
Illustrate the architecture of your deployed application. Remember, you developed a client-server application. Illustrate the server component and to where it is deployed, illustrate a client component, and show how these communicate with each other.

'Chirp! is implemented as a client-server web application.
The client is a web browser that renders Razor Pages generated by the server.
The server is an ASP.NET Core application built from Chirp.Web and deployed using GitHub Actions.
The server communicates with a relational database through ChatDBContext using Entity Framework Core.
All communication between client and server is performed over HTTPS.'

### User activities
Illustrate typical scenarios of a user journey through your Chirp! application. That is, start illustrating the first page that is presented to a non-authorized user, illustrate what a non-authorized user can do with your Chirp! application, and finally illustrate what a user can do after authentication.

Make sure that the illustrations are in line with the actual behavior of your application.

'A non-authenticated user is presented with the public timeline rendered by Public.cshtml.
Non-authenticated users can view cheeps but cannot post cheeps or follow other users.
The user can authenticate using ASP.NET Identity login functionality.
After authentication, the user can post cheeps, follow other authors, and view personalized timelines such as MyPage and FollowingTimeline.
Authenticated users can log out at any time.'

### Sequence of functionality/calls trough Chirp!
With a UML sequence diagram, illustrate the flow of messages and data through your Chirp! application. Start with an HTTP request that is send by an unauthorized user to the root endpoint of your application and end with the completely rendered web-page that is returned to the user.

Make sure that your illustration is complete. That is, likely for many of you there will be different kinds of "calls" and responses. Some HTTP calls and responses, some calls and responses in C# and likely some more. (Note the previous sentence is vague on purpose. I want that you create a complete illustration.)

'The sequence starts with an HTTP GET request to the root endpoint by a non-authenticated user.
The request is handled by a Razor Page in Chirp.Web.
The page model invokes repository methods through application-level abstractions.
CheepRepository retrieves cheep data from the database via ChatDBContext.
The retrieved data is mapped to DTOs and returned to the Razor Page.
The Razor Page renders the HTML response, which is sent back to the client browser.'

## Process
### Build, test, release, and deployment
Illustrate with a UML activity diagram how your Chirp! applications are build, tested, released, and deployed. That is, illustrate the flow of activities in your respective GitHub Actions workflows.

Describe the illustration briefly, i.e., how your application is built, tested, released, and deployed.

'Build, test, and deployment are automated using the GitHub Actions workflow bdsagroup23chirprazor2025.yml.
On each push or pull request, the solution is built using the .NET SDK.
The test projects in test/ are executed, including unit and integration tests.
If all tests pass, the application is deployed to the hosting environment.
A failing build or test step prevents deployment.'

### Team work
Show a screenshot of your project board right before hand-in. Briefly describe which tasks are still unresolved, i.e., which features are missing from your applications or which functionality is incomplete.

Briefly describe and illustrate the flow of activities that happen from the new creation of an issue (task description), over development, etc. until a feature is finally merged into the main branch of your repository.

'The project board reflects the state of development immediately before hand-in.
A small number of tasks remain unresolved, primarily related to optional features and UI polish.
All required functionality for the Chirp! application is implemented.

Development starts with the creation of an issue describing a task.
A feature branch is created from main.
The feature is implemented and tested locally.
A pull request is opened and reviewed.
After approval, the changes are merged into the main branch.'

### How to make Chirp! work locally
There has to be some documentation on how to come from cloning your project to a running system. That is, Adrian or Helge have to know precisely what to do in which order. Likely, it is best to describe how we clone your project, which commands we have to execute, and what we are supposed to see then.

'The repository is cloned from GitHub.
Dependencies are restored using dotnet restore.
The database is initialized using Entity Framework Core migrations.
The application is started using dotnet run from the Chirp.Web project.
The application is accessible in a web browser on the configured local port.' OBS potentially add user secrets not sure if it works without.

### How to run test suite locally
List all necessary steps that Adrian or Helge have to perform to execute your test suites. Here, you can assume that we already cloned your repository in the step above.

Briefly describe what kinds of tests you have in your test suites and what they are testing.

## Ethics
### License
State which software license you chose for your application.

'The application is released under the MIT License.
'

### LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
State which LLM(s) were used during development of your project. In case you were not using any, just state so. In case you were using an LLM to support your development, briefly describe when and how it was applied. Reflect in writing to which degree the responses of the LLM were helpful. Discuss briefly if application of LLMs sped up your development or if the contrary was the case.

ChatGPT was used during development as a support tool.
It was primarily used for explanations, code suggestions, and assistance with documentation.
The responses were helpful for understanding concepts and accelerating development.
All generated content was reviewed and adapted manually.
Overall, the use of LLMs reduced development time without replacing developer judgment.
